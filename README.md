Scream is a text-based micro-blogging platform created with PHP and MySQL. It is designed for people who believe that words still matter. In a world full of visuals and empty metrics, Scream brings conversation back to its simplest form: text. 

Every interaction on Scream occurs through messages, posts, and anonymous chats. This makes it a space where ideas matter more than appearances. The platform encourages free speech and genuine expression. Users can share their thoughts, opinions, or confessions without fear of judgment or pressure about their identity. 

Scream focuses on simplicity, speed, and openness. It reimagines social networking as a place for honest communication, where your words carry more weight than your profile.
